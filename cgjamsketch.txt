Covent Garden Raspberry Jam

About #cgjam

A raspberry jam (link to community site on Raspberry Pi website) is the collective term for a bunch of raspberry pi enthusiasts and their friends. As a jam, we welcome coding peers of all ages from <8 to 256+ as long as groan ups are escorted by a younger coder in case they get stuck! (Jam can get very messy.)

Dragon Hall community centre (link to tech hub site) was the first home of the jam, based in the heart of soho, it is well placed to offer opportunities to learn tech without having cost of equipment in your way. Check the site for details of their code club, coder dojo, tech days and naturally our very own raspberry jam.

This site is dedicated to one of the best women in tech the world will ever know, we'll never forget her, Wendy Lynch, (link) devoted to enabling people of all ages to embrace their potential regardles of age, gender or sexuality. This is in line with everthing #cgjam stands for and she remains at the heart of everything we do!
