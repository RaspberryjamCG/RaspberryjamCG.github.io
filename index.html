<h1> #cgjam<h1>

<p>Covent garden raspberry jam is a very informal but well attended get together for all the family based in the centre of soho</p>

<p>We focus on getting children and adults to try out coding and hacking activities with the raspberry pi at centre stage</p>

<p>The next event will be in September at a community centre very close to our hearts, Dragon Hall, which also happens to be a tech hub, making technology accessible to anyone with an interest!</p>
