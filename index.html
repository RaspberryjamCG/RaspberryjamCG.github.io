  <h2>About #cgjam</h2>

  <p><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/jam/"> A Raspberry jam </a>  is the collective term for a bunch of raspberry pi enthusiasts and their friends. As a jam, we welcome coding peers of all ages from &lt; 8 to 256+ as long as groan ups are escorted by a younger coder in case they get stuck! (Jam can get very messy.) </p>

  <p>
    They were the brain child of <a href="http://www.edutalk.info/tag/teknoteacher/">Alan O'Donohoe</a>, who now works for Exa education, please do check the link for the most amazing rap you will ever hear!
  </p>

  <p> <a href="http://www.dragonhall.org.uk/innovation/">Dragon Hall community centre</a>  was the first home of the jam, based in the heart of soho, it is well placed to offer opportunities to learn tech without having cost of equipment in your way. Check the site for details of their code club, coder dojo, tech days and naturally our very own raspberry jam.</p>

  <p>This site is dedicated to one of the best women in tech the world will ever know, <a href="https://blog.codeclub.org.uk/2016/03/22/remembering-code-club-volunteer-wendy-lynch/"> Wendy Lynch</a>  She was devoted to enabling people of all ages to embrace their potential regardles of age, gender or sexuality. This is in line with everything #cgjam stands for and she remains at the heart of everything we do!</p>
